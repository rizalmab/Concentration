# Concentration

Description:
Compete in a tense game of card-snapping with the computer. Concentrate!

The rules:
A deck of 52 cards is split equally between the player and computer. You and the computer will take turns putting down one card. The next turn, the current card (of the previous turn) will move into the previous card slot, and the previous card will move into the discard pile.
When the previous and current cards meet a certain condition(s), press the ‘SNAP’ button faster than the computer.
